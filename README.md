# House Mini Project

This project creates a 3D-like house drawing using Pycairo, a Python library for creating vector graphics. The project includes code to draw a house layout with slanted windows, a roof, walls, and other architectural details. 

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script to run the drawing code.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies needed to run the project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ianodhiambo1/house_mini).

## Features

- Creates a 3D-like representation of a house.
- Draws slanted windows to resemble real-life architecture.
- Includes customizable colors and line widths for different parts of the house.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Cairo graphics library installed. (Pycairo requires this as a dependency.)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ianodhiambo1/house_mini.git
   cd house_mini
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to generate the house drawing:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The output will be saved as a PNG file (`output.png`) in the project directory.

## Example Output

Include a screenshot of `output.png` here for reference.

## Troubleshooting

### Pycairo Installation Issues

Pycairo might need additional libraries to be installed, especially on Linux. You can install the required libraries as follows:
- **Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libcairo2-dev
  ```
- **MacOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install cairo
  ```
